================

  
## Overview

  
This repository contains preregistration, data, code, and (an eventual) reproducible manuscript/supplement for a project entitled "The Road Not Taken: Investigating Counterfactual Curiosity in Young Children and Chimpanzees."

There has been previous research showing that both preschoolers (FitzGibbon et al., 2019) and adults (e.g., Summerville, 2019) are curious about information that does not have an immediate strategic benefit to them; however, there is little information about the ontogenetic and phylogenetic origins of this curiosity. 

Through an experimental design, we investigate how a type of curiosity known as counterfactual curiosity develops in adult chimpanzees and children between the ages of two and five. Specifically, we study children and chimpanzees' post-decision curiosity and how they seek information independently. 

Our goal is to examine two areas of literature that have not been examined in depth: 

First, when do children begin to seek information regardless of its immediate practical gain? 

Second, does intrinsically driven curiosity occur only in humans or is it also observed in chimpanzees?
